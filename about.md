### Discover Joshua

**"Primarily an introverted individual, he's scattered with occasional extroverted and proactive traits. It seems like he has numerous personas within him."**

* He enjoys learning foreign languages. (Every conversation in a foreign language brings a refreshing change in his mindset and paradigm.)
* He loves both watching and playing soccer. (He's been rooting for Liverpool FC since 2005.)
* Solo travel is his passion. Experiencing unfamiliar landscapes and people triggers a sense of metacognition, providing fresh inspiration and motivation.
* He pursues organization, note-taking, and minimalism. (That's why there isn't much furniture and clutter in his home.)
* He has a fondness for public speaking and speeches. (The feeling of making knowledge truly his own when presenting in front of audience is incredibly satisfying.)
* He approaches everything with a sense of ownership, avoiding half-hearted efforts. (whether it's his own tasks, someone else's, or work-related matters in the company.)
