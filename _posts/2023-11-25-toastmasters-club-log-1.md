> Having recently become a member of JBTM last month, today marked my inaugural participation in the weekly in-person meeting. This occasion introduced me to a diverse array of our old members and new guests.

I’m crafting this article to reflect on my experience joining JBTM, short for Jamsil Brunch Toastmasters Club, situated in Seoul, South Korea.

Since my initial membership at FJUTM (Fu Jen Catholic University, 輔大國際英語演講社FJUTM) in New Taipei City, Taiwan, back in 2018, my journey has consistently intertwined with Toastmasters Clubs due to my profound passion for public speaking and connecting with many global friends.

Today, as one of the newly joined members of JBTM, I undertook my icebreaker speech as part of my Toastmasters pathway titled “Presentation Mastery.”

The purpose of my icebreaker speech was to familiarize the existing members with who I am, my character, and my personal growth journey. I titled it “Joshua, the Comfort Zone Hater”, signifying my continuous efforts to challenge myself across various academic studies, cultures, environments, and foreign languages.

Individuals join Toastmasters Clubs for various reasons, such as learning foreign languages, making connections with local communities, conquering public speaking fears, and expressing their thoughts logically, persuasively, and coherently, step by step.

In my case, though I may not pinpoint precisely why I’m drawn to Toastmasters Club, I consistently find joy in expressing my thoughts, sharing feedback, and engaging in multilingual conversations. Regardless of my concrete motivations, my series of active participation in Toastmasters Clubs undeniably has instilled confidence in speaking across diverse settings. Thanks to the Toastmasters Club, I never feel lost or anxious when delivering speeches in business meetings or on official stages.

Stay tuned to witness my journey with Toastmasters Club as a comfort zone hater and a challenge lover!
