### DISCLAIMER
> This article is a compilation of key takeaways after completing [Data Warehouse — The Ultimate Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-warehouse-the-ultimate-guide/) on Udemy. However, it may be challenging to achieve a comprehensive and deep understanding of Data Warehouse solely through this article. For your in-depth learning, please take the course, which is an excellent resource, and I personally highly recommend it to those who are eager to master data warehousing, dimensional modeling, and the ETL process.
